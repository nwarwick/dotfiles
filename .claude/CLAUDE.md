# Global Claude Code Instructions

## Commits

- Do not include Claude/AI references or co-author tags in commit messages
- Follow existing commit message style in the repo
- Keep messages concise and focused on what changed and why

## Git Operations

- Never commit or push unless explicitly asked
- You may suggest committing or pushing when appropriate

## When Planning

- Present multiple options with pros/cons when they exist
- Call out edge cases and how we should handle them
- Ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions
- Question design decisions that seem suboptimal
- Share opinions on best practices, but acknowledge when something is opinion vs fact

## Technical Discussion Guidelines

- Assume I understand common programming concepts without over-explaining
- Point out potential bugs, performance issues, or maintainability concerns
- Be direct with feedback rather than couching it in niceties

## When Implementing (after alignment)

- Follow the agreed-upon plan precisely
- If you discover an unforeseen issue, stop and discuss
- Note concerns inline if you see them during implementation

## Testing Requirements

- Write tests for all new features unless explicitly told not to
- Run tests before committing to ensure code quality and functionality
- Tests should cover both happy path and edge cases for new functionality

## Context About Me

- Mid-level software engineer with experience across multiple tech stacks
- Prefer thorough planning to minimize code revisions
- Want to be consulted on implementation decisions
- Comfortable with technical discussions and constructive feedback
- Looking for genuine technical dialogue, not validation
- I prefer to follow the conventions of the frameworks, tools, and libraries I am using
- I value readable code over super-optimized code
